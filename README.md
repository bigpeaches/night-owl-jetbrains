# Night Owl Color Scheme (for JetbrainsÂ® IDEs) ðŸŒŒ  

> Night owl *theme* and *colour scheme* for IntelliJÂ® and WebstormÂ® :jack_o_lantern:

Adaption of [Sarah Drasner's Night Owl](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) VSCode theme for WebstormÂ® and IntelliJÂ® based on [Material UI Jetbrains](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) and [Rainbow Brackets](https://github.com/izhangzhihao/intellij-rainbow-brackets). Due to the *syntax highlighting* for JetbrainsÂ® IDE's being slightly different, the highlighting won't 100% reproduce that of the VS Code plugin, but it's very similar. You can [vote](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEABKL-5473) to help with this.

### Installation

Installation is not the easiest, due to Jetbrains Material UI not having released custom theme imports yet. If you find a simpler way of installing this you are more than welcome to PR. :star2:

1. Install [Material Theme UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui)  and [Rainbow Brackets](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10080-rainbow-brackets) by going to `Preferences` under `Plugins` and click `Browse Repositories`, to search and install  (**Preferences** > **Plugins** > **Browse Repositories**)

    ![Step 2](instructions1.png)

2. Install **Night Owl Theme** in the same way

3. Go to **Tools** > **Material Theme** > **Material Theme Chooser** > **External Themes** >  **Night Owl Theme** 

4. **Restart** your IDE

    



Adjust as needed from Material UI settings in Preferences, or adjust colors from Color Scheme in Preferences.
