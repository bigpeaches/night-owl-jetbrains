    <description><![CDATA[
    Night Owl theme and colour scheme based on Sarah Drasner's VSCode one.

   A theme for the night owls out there. Works well in the daytime, too,
    but this theme is fine-tuned for those of us who like to code late into the night.
    Color choices have taken into consideration what is accessible to people with colorblindness
    and in low-light circumstances. Decisions were also based on meaningful contrast for reading
    comprehension and for optimal razzle dazzle.
